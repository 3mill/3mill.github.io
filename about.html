  <h2 class="gray-text">about this robert</h2>
  <p>I am an aspiring web developer who is mainly focused on Ruby. 
  Why did I become a programmer? Why Ruby?</p>


<p class="box">"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure
  thought-stuff.  He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by 
  exertion of the imagination.  Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy
  to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structure."
