<b>[verse 1]</b>
As I walk through the office, back to my desk
I take a look at my code, and realize there's nothing left
'Cause I've been <a class="red"href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass'n</a> and laughing so long
That even my <a class="red" href="http://haml.info">HAML</a> thinks that my mind is gone

But I aint ever crossed a WAN that didn't support git
Me check into a Clearcase/trunk? You know that's <a class="red" href="http://bitworking.org/news/ClearCase_as_a_leading_indicator_of_small_technology_company_failure">unheard of</a>
You better watch how ya talkin
And where you blockin
Or you and your controllers might <a class="red" href="http://therailsway.com/2007/6/1/railsconf-recap-skinny-controllers">have more logic than Spock</a>

I really hate to <a class="red" href="http://jruby.org">JIT</a>, but I gotta though
As they <a class="red" href="http://merbist.com/2011/10/03/about-concurrency-and-the-gil/">croak</a>, I see myself in the VM smoke
Fool

I'm the kinda g the little homies wanna be like
On <a class="red" href="http://github.com/rlqualls/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc">vimrc</a> in the night
Submitting pulls in the screen light

<b>[chorus]</b>
We've been spending most our lives, living in a Tester's Paradise
We've been spending most our lives, living in a Tester's Paradise
We keep spending most our lives, living in a Tester's Paradise
We keep spending most our lives, living in a Tester's Paradise

<b>[verse 2]</b>
They got <a class="red" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/ff637362.aspx">Team Foundation</a>, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life - I was raised by the <a class="red" href="http://confreaks.com">l33t</a>
So I gotta be down with the <a class="red" href="http://openvim.com/tutorial.html">vim</a> team
Too much configuration got me <a class="red" href="http://vimgolf.com">chasing keys</a>

I'm an <a class="red" href="http://codeschool.com/users/rlqualls">educated</a> fool with money on my mind
Got my <a class="red" href="http://rubygems.org">gem</a> in my hand, and TDD in VI
I'm <a class="red" href="http://rspec.info">spec'd</a> out tester, set-trippin' <a class="red" href="http://cukes.info">cuker</a>,
And my stories is down, so don't arouse my features
Fool

Wealth aint nothin but a <a class="red" href="http://heroku.com">deploy</a> away
I'm livin life do or die, what can I say?
I'm twenty-three now but will I be poor at twenty-fo
The way things is going I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see that the ones we hurt are proprietary

<b>[chorus]</b>
We've been spending most our lives, living in a Tester's Paradise
We've been spending most our lives, living in a Tester's Paradise
We keep spending most our lives, living in a Tester's Paradise
We keep spending most our lives, living in a Tester's Paradise

<b>[verse 3]</b>
Power in the money, <a class="red" href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/amzn">money in the power</a>
Image after Image, hour after hour
Everybody's <a class="red" href="http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/">cloud'n</a>, but half of them aint lookin
At what's going on in the kitchen, so <a class="red" href="http://server.dzone.com/articles/how-completely-fail-bdd">I don't know what's cuking</a>

They say I got to ship, but <a class="red" href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails">nobody's here to beat me</a>
If they can't unit test, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't
I guess they <a class="red" href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/how-can-i-motivate-coworkers-to-write-unit-tests/">won't</a>
I guess they're @%^*#$

That's why I know their life is out of luck
Fool

<b>[chorus]</b>
We've been spending most our lives, living in a Tester's Paradise
We've been spending most our lives, living in a Tester's Paradise
We keep spending most our lives, living in a Tester's Paradise
We keep spending most our lives, living in a Tester's Paradise

Tell me why are we so blind to see that the ones we hurt are <a class="red" href="http://asp.net">proprietary</a>
Tell me why are we so blind to see that the ones we hurt are proprietary
