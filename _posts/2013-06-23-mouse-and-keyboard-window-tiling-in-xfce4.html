<p>I like tiling window managers like i3, dwm, or xmonad. Aside from
  making me feel like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=mIq9jFdEfZo#t=29s">
    Boris Grishenko</a>, being able to manipulate a desktop without 
  a mouse is especially handy when there's simply no mouse available.
After all, trackpads aren't exactly the hallmark of human-computer-interaction.</p>

<p>However, most software isn't written with tiling windows in mind, so a pure tile-based
  approach can cause problems or at least awkward side-effects (dialog boxes 
  taking up half a screen, for example). So I sought a hybrid approach, and so far,
Xfce4 seems to be doing the job pretty well.</p>

<p>Keyboard shortcuts for window tiling in Xfce4 can be bound at:

  <p class="box">Applications Menu  -> Settings -> Window Manager</p>

<p>Being able to tile with the keyboard is nice, but I often am using a mouse, and one of the 
  things I like about Windows 7 (gasp!) is the ability to tile a window by dragging it to the edge
  of the screen. After all, it's just as annoying to have reach for the keyboard when your hand
  is already on the mouse.  By default, Xfce4 moves a window to the next workspace when it is
  dragged to the edge (at least in the arch linux package I used). Fortunately, this
  can be changed via the Settings Editor, which can be found at:</p> 

<p class="box">Applications Menu -> Settings -> Settings Editor</p> 

<p>

</p>

<p>Just uncheck "wrap_windows" under xfwm4, and windows should
  tile when they are dragged to the edge.</p>

<p>Note: If for some reason you need the command line to pull up these windows, you can access
  the main settings manager window with xfce4-settings-manager.</p>
