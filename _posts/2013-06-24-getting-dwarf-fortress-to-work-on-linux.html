<p>Today, I decided to see if I could get Dwarf Fortress (v0.34.11) running in my 64-bit Arch Linux environment.
  Immediately, I had a problem .</p>

</p>

<p> Doing some googling took me to <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=4146">
    this page</a>, which didn't help me much since it claimed the issue was resolved in an earlier version.</p>

<p> It then occurred to me that I never tried running the game as root.  Now, running 3rd party software
  as root is generally considered a bad idea, since it could conceivably do something like 
  <a href="http://mythipedia.wikia.com/wiki/Myth_II:_Soulblighter#Myth_II_Installer_bug" class="red">
    wipe your whole hard drive.</a> I decided to take my chances, and - lo and behold - it worked!
  
  Now I might be stupid enough to run a piece of software as root, but I'm smart enough to stop
  while I'm ahead. The Dwarf Fortress 0.34.11 installation folder is /opt/df_linux, and it appears 
  that Dwarf Fortress requires permissions to be wide open (7).</p>

<p>If you want everyone on the computer to have the ability to play Dwarf Fortress, just issue the
    following command:</p>

<p class="terminal">sudo chmod -R 777 /opt/df_linux</p>

<p>The key here is that you issue **7 as the permission code. This makes read, write, and execute
  possible for every file in /opt/df_linux, for every user. The -R flag is what sets permissions recursively.
  An alternative is using a 7** code and using chown to set the owner of the files as your username.

<p class="terminal">
  sudo chmod -R 711 /opt/df_linux <br />
  sudo chown -R username /opt/df_linux
</p> 
  
<p>This problem is probably specific to my Arch package, but it could happen on any system 
  where permissions are not properly configured during the installation process. If you would like
  to know more about how chmod sets permissions, go <a href="http://catcode.com/teachmod/">here</a>.</p>
